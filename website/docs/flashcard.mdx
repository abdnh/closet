title: Flashcard types
---

Many filters display an effect than is categorized as a _flashcard effect_.
They are called that, because the effect only really make sense in the context of flashcards.
They include:

- clozes
- multiple choice questions (MCQs)
- shuffling as flashcard types
- specifications
- occlusions

They all have a few concepts in common:

## Question and answer context

The rendering of the effect needs to _context-sensitive_.
Depending on the context the effect needs to be rendered differently:

1. as a _question_, _test_, or _front_, it needs to show the user what is the task at hand, that needs to be answered.

:::tip Examples
For *clozes*, this could be an ellipsis, or a hint; for *MCQs*, this would typically be the answer options.
:::

1. as the _answer_, _reveal_, or _back_, it needs to provide a solution to the question.

:::tip Examples
For *clozes*, this would be the revealed answer; for *MCQs* it would need to provide some highlight to the correct answer.
:::

For flashcards, _test_ will be synonmymous with the _front_, _answer_ with the _back_.

## Active and inactive effects

In a flashcard, you usually want to test each piece of knowledge individually.
This is also called the [minimum information principle](https://www.supermemo.com/de/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules#minimum%20information%20principle).
In Anki, this is facilitated in the form of cards.

```closet
The capital of Portugal is [[c1::Lisbon]]. Its area is [[c2::92kmÂ²]].
```

Using the above template, we could create two different cards, both testing one piece of knowledge on the note.
This introduces the notion of _active_ flashcard effect, compared to _inactive_ ones.

In Anki, on a card "**Card 1**", the active flashcard effects would end in a _1_, like `c1`, or `mc1` whereas `c2`/`mc2` are inactive, and vice versa.
Within Closet we can be more flexibile, but generally we will adhere to this convention.

## Summary

Altogether, a flashcard effect can be rendered in four different ways:

|            | question  | answer |
|:-----------|-----------|--------|
| active     |           |        |
| inactive   |           |        |
