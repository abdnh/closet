title: Flashcard Filters
---

_Flashcard filters_ describe a family of filters that are especially useful for flashcards.
They include:

- clozes
- multiple choice questions (MCQs)
- shuffling as flashcard types
- specifications
- occlusions

They all have a few concepts in common:

## Question and answer context

The rendering of the effect is _context-sensitive_.
Depending on the context the effect is rendered differently:

1. as a _question_, _test_, or _front_, it needs to show the user the task to be solved, the question to be answered.

:::info Examples
For *clozes*, this could be an ellipsis, or a hint; for *MCQs*, this would typically be the answer options.
:::

2. as the _answer_, _reveal_, or _back_, it needs to provide a solution to the prior task or question.

:::info Examples
For *clozes*, this would be the revealed answer; for *MCQs* it would need to provide some highlight to the correct answer.
:::

For flashcards, _test_ will be synonmymous with the _front_, _answer_ with the _back_.

## Active and inactive context

In a flashcard, you usually want to test each piece of knowledge individually.
This is also called the [minimum information principle](https://www.supermemo.com/de/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules#minimum%20information%20principle).
In Anki, this is facilitated in the form of cards.

```closet
The capital of Portugal is [[c1::Lisbon]]. Its area is [[c2::92kmÂ²]].
```

Using the above template, we could create two different cards, both testing one piece of knowledge on the note.
This introduces the notion of _active_ flashcard effect, compared to _inactive_ ones.

In Anki, on a card **Card 1**, the active flashcard effects end in a _1_, like `c1`, or `mc1` whereas `c2`/`mc2` are inactive, and vice versa.
Within Closet we can be more flexibile, but generally we will adhere to this convention.
