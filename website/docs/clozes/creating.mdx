## What are clozes?

According to Wikipedia:

> A cloze test (also cloze deletion test) is an exercise, test, or assessment consisting of a portion of language with certain items, words, or signs removed (cloze text), where the participant is asked to replace the missing language item.

## Unnumbered Clozes

Clozes are surrounded by c tags.
By default, an unnumbered cloze will always be considered inactive.

<Example name="clozesNothingHappens" />

As you can see, absolutely nothing happens.
This is the specified behavior: the tag is inactive, and the default behavior for inactive clozes of this kind is to show their content.

You can make this more interesting by either using numbered clozes, or by using hiding or revealing clozes.
